# New-York-City-Airbnb-Open-Data
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. In this project, I would be exploring the dataset learning more about how the listings in New York City are prices in different buroughs.  I will also be building a machine learning model predict the price of listings.
